Output terminals (140,150) for connecting the batteries are connected to the tabs of the electrode terminals received by and held between the spacers. The output terminals project outwards through the cutouts formed in a portion at the surrounding wall (71b) of a lower case (71). Insertion openings of the insulating covers provide a connection to an external device for detecting the voltage or controlling the charging or discharging of the batteries.    USE - For a vehicle such as a car or a train.    ADVANTAGE - The use of spacers or insulating plates to receive the electrode terminals or tabs of the batteries prevents the electrode terminals from being subjected to stress or fatigue caused by vibrations applied to the battery module. Dampening of vibrations by the use of the spacers improves the durability of the electrode terminals and the durability of the battery module. Using insulating plates to receive the electrode terminals prevents or reduces short-circuiting. When the instances of short-circuiting are reduced or prevented, a small vertical gap between the batteries and the terminals is allowed and the construction of a compact battery module is facilitated. A compact battery module with improved vibration resistance is provided. Because insulating spacers are located at both ends of batteries, exposure to the electrode terminals is reduced to ease the handling of the cell unit during the assembly of the battery module and to improve the quality. The battery modules are connected to form a battery assembly having a desired current, voltage and capacity to serve as a power source for a motor used to drive a vehicle. When assembled, the battery modules and their flat batteries are spaced from each other so that the space serves as a passageway for allowing the cooling air to cool each battery module and to prevent the degradation of battery charging efficiency by controlling its heat-degradation. By providing insertion openings in the insulating plate where the electrode terminals project, a portion of the electrode terminal is exposed that allows the dissipation of heat from the electrode terminal when charging or discharging a battery. The insertion openings prevent dew condensation on the electrode terminal resulting from repeated heating and cooling of the electrode terminals to prevent the erosion of the batteries.

1981A4912D|The electrical storage battery is constructed with anode and cathode plates arranged in a radial configuration within a cylindrical case. The plates are supported within a rack which maintains a proper radial alignment.    The radial arrangement of the flat plates enhances the stability of current and voltage during discharge, since the plates are more uniformly transverse with respect to the direction of propagation of molecular high pressure systems which proceed in generally circular paths from the centre of such an arrangement. Ions can be accelerated into orderly circular motion, and as a consequence of this circular motion, density waves of the ions will be formed and will move in an orderly fashion. This promotes more efficient reaction of ion radicals and minimises the energy loss due to unnecessary collisions among the ions themselves and collisions with the confining walls of the casing.

The controller detects that the vehicle is operating in a way that can draw power from battery cells (301-305), and is responsive to detecting that the vehicle is operating to draw power from the battery cells; causes the battery cells to reconfigure into the series connection, and to produce an output voltage equivalent to a sum of all of the battery voltages summed together; and reconfigures the battery connections so that the batteries are connected in parallel.    USE - The battery bank is for a vehicle, i.e. electrically operated vehicle, preferably electric driven automobile (claimed). The vehicle is electric vehicle or hybrid vehicle.    ADVANTAGE - Charging of batteries within an electric-driven vehicle is facilitated.

The electric vehicle batteries can be charged in a more economical way. Instead of producing energy that is used for the automobile while the automobile is operational and moving, or trying to scrub the output from the automobile while it is running, surfaces of the automobile are used during times when the automobile is not in use. During the time that the car is parked, its surface area is used to capture solar rays, which are used in a way that may prevent or reduce carbon dioxide pollution. The surface area may be used to power the automobile itself, or may use some kind of carbon dioxide scrubbing.

A vehicle that is parked in the sun all day could produce 800 W hours with a 100 W solar cell, i.e. almost the entire charging capacity of the battery, thus the battery could be almost fully charged by the sun during this time if the voltage issue could be handled. The charging system for vehicle rearranges the bank of battery cells between a series connection for delivering voltage to a load, e.g. a motor (125); and a parallel connection for being charged.

The controller detects that the vehicle is operating in a way that can draw power from the battery cells, and is responsive to detecting that the vehicle is operating to draw power from the battery cells; causes the battery cells to reconfigure into the series connection, and to produce an output voltage equivalent to a sum of all of the battery voltages summed together; detects a second mode, where the vehicle is not operating in a way that draws power from the battery cells, and is responsive to detecting the second mode where power is not being drawn; and reconfigures the battery connections so that the batteries are connected in parallel.

The change rate estimating unit performs parameter identification based on the battery model equation using battery temperature, battery voltage and battery current detected by a detecting unit as well as initial state parameter value corresponding to present battery state based on the data read from a storing unit, and estimates the parameter change rate.    USE - Device for estimating state of secondary battery for e.g. electric vehicle and hybrid vehicle.    ADVANTAGE - Allows dynamic estimation of an internal state of the secondary battery. Prevents degrading of estimation accuracy due to an influence by changes in parameter value corresponding to changes in battery state when parameter identification in a battery model equation is performed, and ensures an estimation accuracy of the battery model corresponding to secular change of the battery. Eliminates an influence exerted by significant and rapid changes, i.e., of small time constants, caused by the changes in battery state. The secular change in parameter value due to secular deterioration of the battery can be stably estimated so that the parameter identification can be performed while avoiding a delay in estimation and deterioration of the estimation accuracy The secular change of the parameter value can be appropriately reflected in the battery model equation, therefore, even when the deterioration and/or manufacturing variations occur in the battery, the state of the secondary battery can be accurately estimated. The degree of the battery deterioration can be directly and simply estimated without using a further map or the like. The change rate of the parameter value with respect to the initial state can be estimated independently of the significant changes in parameter value that may occur due to changes in battery state. The current range for identifying the parameter change rate of the direct current (DC) resistance can be determined to exclude a battery-relaxation state and a state of charging/discharging with a large current, thereby, it is possible to prevent erroneous estimation of any change in diffusion resistance of the secondary battery due to deterioration as a change in DC resistance. Enables to prevent such a situation that the change in diffusion resistance due to deterioration is erroneously determined as the changes in DC resistance. The change rate of the diffusion parameter with respect to the initial state can be estimated independently of large changes in diffusion parameter caused by changes in battery state, without using a nonlinear adaptive digital filter or the like for the diffusion parameter, e. g., diffusion constant, including a diffusion speed of the reaction-participating material inside the secondary battery.

After providing sufficient time (i.e. several R-C time constants) for the capacitors to charge, switches (22A-22D/24A-24D) are opened. Switches (26A-26D/28A-28D) are then closed, placing the capacitors in parallel with each other and after a sufficient time, their charges will equalize through the resistors and the switches are then open. Switches (22A-22D/24A-24D) are then closed and with the capacitors having equal voltages (average voltages of the batteries), the capacitors will tend to equalize the voltages of the batteries.
