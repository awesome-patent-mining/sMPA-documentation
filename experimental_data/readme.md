## **Experimental data introduction**
There are four files in this folder to demonstrate the usage of sMPA, where citation_network_raw.net is a citation network stored in pajek's. net file format, and citation_network_spc.net and  citation_network_splc.net are its spc (search path count) and splc (search path link count) versions. patent_texts.csv contains the text content of each node. Specifically, each row in patent_texts.csv consists of two columns, namely ID column and abstract column, the former describe the ID number of the node which is a patent number, and the latter is the patent's abstract field.
